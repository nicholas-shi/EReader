# EReader
## Overview
Application that stores and can read eBooks. The motivation for creating this application is in response to apple's iOS 15 update. Prior to iOS 15, it was possible for a user to load a eBook in the iBooks application and use the natively built in speak screen feature to read the book. Users can then listen to the eBook while navigating on other applications, keeping the phone on the lock screen, or simply remaining on the app.

With the update to iOS 15, this is no longer possible. If the phone is locked or iBooks is running in the background, speak screen will only finish reading the current page and sometimes the following page. Even when the app is kept open for reading, there is now a noticable delay when flipping pages in iBooks while reading.
